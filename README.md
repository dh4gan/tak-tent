tak-tent: a simulator for (radio) SETI
======================================

This Python code (in development) runs an agent-based simulation of a SETI survey.

The intention is to develop a flexible code capable of Monte Carlo Realisation.

This will allow observation strategies to be tested, and to determine what types of transmitter can be detected for a given survey mode.

The Code
--------

The code is composed of five classes: 

`Vector3D` - a 3D cartesian vector class
`Agent` - a generic agent base class
`Transmitter(Agent)` - a transmitting civilisation
`Observer(Agent)` - an observing civilisation
`Population` - a class that defines the combined population of Transmitters and Observers
